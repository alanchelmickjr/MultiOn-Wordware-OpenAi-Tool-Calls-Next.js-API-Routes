# multion-wordware-agentops-hackathon
Here is the code I built since Friday evening, I am a Python programmer and Javascript so Typescript is new to me but I am making the curve.  You will not find agentops code here or mem0 as they were already integrated into my backend and thus are just calls and I
did not have time to rewrite hackathon copies as I did for multion, wordware

You can use the LIVE version here --> https://myriadai.online  but the free version is limited, didn't make you a copy yet. :D

3 minutes or less demo here --> https://youtu.be/HcjcZD3a-Z8

Tool configurations and code to deploy Multion Browse and Scrape, all 4 Wordware Templates &amp;
Utlizing Claude, Groq & mem0 AgentOps <- integrated these tools PRE hackathon so, no credit for hackthon coding :D
